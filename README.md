# Text Generation using LSTM

This project demonstrates text generation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

Text generation is the task of generating new text based on input data. In this project, we use LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to generate text character by character. LSTM networks are well-suited for this task because they can learn patterns and dependencies in sequences of data.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-lstm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd text-generation-lstm
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python text_generation_lstm.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to provide input and generate text.
